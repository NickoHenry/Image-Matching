# Image-Matching

This project is an image matching project using the SURF algorithm which functions to perform an 
image local descriptor in placing each unique point in the image and using CLAHE as histogram equalization 
in managing the light intensity in the image and FLANN, the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm which will search 
for an image. match of the two trained images.
